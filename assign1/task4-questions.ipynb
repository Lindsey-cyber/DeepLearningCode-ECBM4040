    "\n",
    "What is the effect of increasing the number of layers in an MLP? Based on your experiments in task 2/3, are larger models (with a greater number of hidden layers) preferred to smaller ones? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Your answer: **Increasing layers in an MLP may capture more complex patterns but can lead to overfitting. Based on my experiments, larger models arenâ€™t always better accuracy(they sometimes just cannot overcome even 60%) to diminishing returns and training instability.**"

    "### Question 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the significance of activation functions in deep learning models? Name two activation functions that you can use for a hidden layer **and** two for the output layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Your answer: **Activation functions introduce non-linearity. For hidden layers: ReLU, Tanh. For output: Sigmoid, Softmax.**"

    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you have a problem to predict the annual rainfall in a certain region with some historic numeric data that was given to you, which of these 2 models (Linear Regression vs. Logistic Regression) would you use? How would you modify the problem statement to use the other model? Do they both adopt a linear decison boundary? \n",
    "\n",
    "   Your answer: **Use Linear Regression for rainfall prediction. Modify to a binary classification (e.g., rain/no rain) to use Logistic Regression. Only Linear Regression adopts a linear decision boundary.**\n"

    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What will happen if you choose a very small or a very large learning rate? \n",
    "\n",
    "   Your answer: **A small learning rate leads to slow convergence, sometimes it just lead to stagnation, while a large one may cause overshooting, disable oscilations or divergence.**"

    "\n",
    "What is the interpretation of **perplexity** in t-SNE? How did you set this value during the tuning in task3?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Your answer: **Perplexity in t-SNE controls local vs. global data structure. larger perplexity value can takes long time to proceed and better classification.**"
